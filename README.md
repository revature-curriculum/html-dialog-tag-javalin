## HTML Dialog Tag
---
### Description
In this lab, you will create a dialog using the button and dialog tags.

---
### Steps
1. In src -> main -> resources -> index.html, create a dialog using the dialog tag
2. Includes two of your favorite quotes(from a movie, show, book, etc.) in the dialog tag. They should be enclosed in the body tag.
3. Create a button that, onclick, opens the dialog window. Use the lesson example as reference. This button should be outside the dialog tag because we want it to be visible if the dialog is closed.
4. In the dialog tag, create a button that closes the dialog window. This button should be enclosed within the dialog tag because we want it to only appear if the dialog is open (since this button will close it).
---

### Sample Output

A button should appear, which when clicked will trigger the dialog to open. This dialog will contain two quotes. There will also be a button in this dialog, which when pressed, will close the dialog.
